> [!NOTE]
> Hello hello, today we are introducing you to a small mini job. With sc_lawn, you get a new gardener job on your server. No annoying driving around with the lawnmower, but an interactive minijob, where you have to drive to plots of land and do small tasks.

## Usage

- To start the job, you must first accept it (in the job center or console)
- Drive to the park, put on your work clothes and press F6 to get a job. Your vehicle, which is also marked on the map, will spawn at the same time.
- Drive to the lot and complete all the tasks to get money. 
- When your job is finished, you can get a new one by pressing F6.
- You can cancel the job with F6, but you will not be paid.
